# HW 1: Randomized & Deterministic Selections

## How to compile
Run `make` command to compile source code.
```
make
```

## How to run
`rdselect` finds i-th smallest element in an array by randomized and deterministic selection algorithms. The index starts from 1. It prints the result and runtime of each algorithm.

Run `rdselect` by this command:
```
./rdselect <index> <input file>
```

To check the correctness of the algorithms, run `rdcheck` like:
```
./rdcheck <index> <input file> <expected result>
```
