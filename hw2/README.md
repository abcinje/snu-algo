# HW 2: Order-Statistic Red-Black Tree

## How to compile
Run `make` command to compile source code.
```
make
```

## How to run
`RB_OSTree` reads the instructions in an input file and executes the corresponding function. There are 4 interfaces that enables us to access the tree: insert, delete, select, and rank. It prints the result to the `output` file.

Run `RB_OSTree` by this command:
```
./RB_OSTree <input file>
```

To check the correctness of the algorithm, run `checker` like:
```
./checker <input file> output
```
